#Owl Internship – Student Performance Analysis

This repository contains my internship work for the **Owl AI Virtual Internship – Data Analyst Task (August 2025)**.  
The project is based on analyzing a **Student Performance Dataset** to identify trends and insights in academics.

Task 1 – Excel Analysis
- Used **Excel** for initial exploration of the dataset.  
- Created **pivot tables and charts** to summarize scores by gender, parental education, and test preparation status.  
- Visualized **gender-wise average scores** and **distribution of high scorers**.  
- Key Insight: Female students performed better in Reading & Writing, while male students had slightly higher Math scores.

Task 2 – Python Analysis
- Performed statistical analysis and data exploration using Python.  
- Cleaned and transformed the dataset for better analysis.  
- Used libraries such as **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** for data handling and visualization.  
- Key Insight: Students whose parents had **higher education levels** tended to achieve better scores overall.

Task 3 – Power BI Dashboard
- Designed an **Interactive Dashboard** in Power BI to combine Excel and Python findings.  
- Dashboard included visuals on:
   - Gender-wise score comparisons  
   - Impact of test preparation course  
   - Parental education vs average scores  
- Key Insight: Participation in test preparation courses significantly improved performance across all subjects.

Key Findings:
-  Female students scored higher in Reading and Writing, while males slightly outperformed in Math.  
-  Higher **parental education** correlated with better student scores.  
-  Test preparation courses had a **positive impact** on academic performance.  
-  Only a **small proportion of students** scored above 90 in all three subjects.  

Tools Used
- **Excel** – Pivot tables, charts, summary statistics  
- **Python** – Data cleaning, statistical analysis, visualizations  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation and interactive insights
